# spotify-web-app
A little project to try to leverage Spotify's Developer API to find out what concerts are playing near me! 

## Story
I went to a Korean restaurant to meet up with a friend, where he introduced me to his startup cofounder. We had a nice conversation, and they had also given me good advice for the startup I am working on myself. So, here is where I'm trying to do a little test of implementing a feature they recommended to me.

## Tools and Explanation Overview
This is my first React app(not React Native I've been there done that) so I'm just gaining experience using that, as well as integrating Spotify's Developer API to send more obvious notifications of when an artist I like is going to be playing near me.
